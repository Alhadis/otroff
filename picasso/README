			MAKING BATCH PICASSO

On some systems, standard yacc may choke on picassoy.y.  If that happens,
you can make a yacc with bigger tables using "make -f picasso.mk yacc" in
this directory.  Then you should be able to make picasso, if your $PATH
includes the current directory.  As far as I know, the only system on
which this is necessary is 6386 UNIX.

Yacc'ing picassoy.y should produce 327 shift/reduce conflicts.

When compiling xstubs.c, your compiler may issue warnings about formal
parameters not being used.  This is not a problem.
