The new 202 is more or less working,
and some order has been brought out of
font chaos.
The attached pages list all of the characters
currently available on the 202.
Note that availability on the 202 does not
imply availability on the Canon printers
or on the MHCC APS-5.
.PP
The 202 has two floppy disk drives.
We have about 130 fonts, and
a single diskette can hold roughly 40-50 fonts.
The typesetter is normally run with one diskette
but can can be run with two.
Accordingly, the fonts have been divided into three
groups:
common and/or new and/or interesting;
less so;
rare and/or old and/or boring.
The division was made capriciously and arbitrarily
but is not likely to change in the near future.
In any case, the result is that fonts in
category 1 will always be available,
fonts in category 2 will probably be available,
and fonts in category 3 will not be unless
you replace a diskette and reboot.
And of course you get to use fonts from only
two diskettes in any one job.
.PP
To make all this work,
some changes have been made in troff as well.
Since two-character names
can't cope with 130+ fonts,
the .fp command in troff now accepts
a third argument to specify a ``real'' name
for a font.
It is used like this:
.DS
	.fp 1 R Gillsans
	.fp 2 I GillsansI
	.fp 3 B GillsansB
.DE
which makes R, I and B synonyms for the corresponding
Gill Sans fonts.
You can use any one or two-letter names instead of
R, I and B.
.PP
.fp 1 R Gillsans
.fp 2 I GillsansI
.fp 3 B GillsansB
(This font is Gill Sans, in case anyone is interested;
.ft I
this is Gill Sans Italic;
.ft B
and this is Gill Sans Bold.)
.PP
.FP times
Since many fonts consist entirely of weird nameless
characters (look at Chempi, for example),
troff now permits access to characters by their absolute number
on a font: \eN\(fm123\(fm refers to character 123 on
the current font.
The lists here show the absolute number for each character
that does not have a real name.
.PP
In the following listings, each font is introduced by
a header of the form
.DS
	ZapfI 92 Zapf Book Light Italic
.DE
The first word is the troff name of the font, suitable
for use in a .fp command.
The number (92) is for internal use by d202.
The rest of the line is the ``official'' descriptive name
of the font, suitable for talking to typographers.
.PP
This is all somewhat tentative,
so don't build anything too complicated
on top of it.
Complaints to bwk.
