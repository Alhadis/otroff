To make troff (actually a.out):

	make

You must have an ANSI C compiler for this.  In a pinch, the awk program
unansi may help you move backwards in time.

You will also need a driver for your favorite output device.
d202.c provides a model, although it is specialized to a machine no
one has.  There are also a variety of postscript drivers that are the
best thing to use if you have a postscript device.  the default output
device is "post".

You will also have to make a DESC file for your typesetter and some
font description files; see dev202 for examples.  These describe the
named characters, widths, kerning information, and output codes.

Nroff is the same program as troff, so you should

	cp a.out /usr/bin/troff
	ln /usr/bin/troff /usr/bin/nroff

or the equivalent.

You will also need terminal description files for your terminals; see
tab.37, tab.450 and tab.lp for examples.

DESC and font description files are normally stored in /usr/lib/font;
macro packages are in /usr/lib/tmac; nroff tables are in
/usr/lib/term.  You can edit tdef.h to change these assumptions.

There have been a few features since the last version, and a number of
significant internal changes.  Not all are improvements, of course.
Most of the more recent changes, including bug fixes, are in FIXES,
which you should read also.
