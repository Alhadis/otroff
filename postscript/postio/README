Serial communications program for PostScript printers.

Runs as a single read/write process (by default). Use the -R2 option
or set splitme to TRUE (file postio.c) to get separate read and write
processes. Although not the default, we recommend using separate read
and write processes.

Sends occasional status queries (control Ts) while transmitting files.
Use the -q option or set quiet (file postio.c) to TRUE to disable status
queries.

Must always include the -l option to select the printer line. Datakit
connections are supported on System V and Ninth Edition systems. The
syntax (for connecting to a Datakit destination) varies. Check the SYSV
and V9 versions of setupline() in file ifdef.c.
