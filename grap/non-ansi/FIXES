7/2/87:
	Added sprintf() to create strings:

	sprintf("fmt", expr, expr, ...) formats exprs
	according to fmt;  may be used in plot, etc.,
	in place of a literal string.
	fmt can only include %f, %g, %e-type conversions;
	it's pretty dumb.

8/15/88:
	Added width attribute for labels, to override deficient computation.

2/3/89:
	added exponentiation operator ^

3/19/89:
	now possible to print gridlines without ticks:
		grid whatever ticks off
	make sure the "ticks off" comes after the side
	AND before the iterator -- this is still a bug/feature.

5/9/89:
	put name of include file in a #define so it can be set
	from command line.

6/13/89:
	fiddled opentemp in print.c to close temporary file more reliably.

7/10/89:
	changed default spot to \(bu.
	added version date for -d option

11/7/89:
	added guessed width to left and right ticks so graph is centered better.

2/2/90:
	added % operator.  don't ask.

2/5/90:
	changed call to rand to use RAND_MAX for normalization.
