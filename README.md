PWB/UNIX `troff` source code (1981)
===================================
An updated (but still ancient) version of AT&T `troff` from circa 1981,
although RCS identifiers indicate more recent modifications (~1988).

As with the earlier 1977 files, the source code here is unlikely to be
useful. The only target device this version of `troff` supported was
the [C/A/T phototypesetter][1], which fed instruction codes directly
to the device. Even if you manage to build it, the program would only
emit gibberish.
