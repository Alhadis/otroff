Troff to PostScript translator. The big change is in the font table
routines. The old binary format and makedev are gone. Troff and dpost
now both read ASCII tables. Translating the ASCII font tables in dpost
(and troff) means some startup overhead. Both programs run a bit slower,
but it's a small price to pay for the added flexibility.

Long PostScript font names can now be included in the font tables.
They should follow the fontname keyword as in,

	fontname Times-Roman

The fontname field helps with the DocumentFonts comment, font name
abbreviations (formally required to be in the prologue), and is used
to manage host resident fonts.

dpost can also now calculate a reasonably tight BoundingBox, which
helps picture inclusion. By default the calculations are disabled.
Use the -B option when you BoundingBox and PageBoundingBox comments.
If you're stubborn and always want the comment set dobbox (in file
dpost.c) to TRUE. You'll still need -B to get the the best fit.

Most other changes are bug fixes. Color support has been improved,
and now works with the drawing routines. The different text encoding
schemes are all still in. Level 2 is well tested and is now the default.
For a different default change DFLTENCODING (file dpost.h). Don't make
level 3 the default unless you can live with ragged right margins.

A typical command line would be,

    pic file | tbl | eqn | troff -mm | dpost >file.ps

file.ps is PostScript and can be sent directly to a printer.
